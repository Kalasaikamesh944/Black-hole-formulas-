# Black Hole Formulas

## Overview
This document provides fundamental formulas related to black holes.

## Formulas

### Formula 1: Schwarzschild Radius
- **Description**: The radius of the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole.
- **Formula**: r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}

### Formula 2: Escape Velocity
- **Description**: The velocity needed to escape the gravitational pull of the black hole from the event horizon.
- **Formula**: v_e = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}

### Formula 3: Time Dilation Near a Black Hole
- **Description**: The effect of gravitational time dilation near the event horizon.
- **Formula**: t' = t \sqrt{1 - \frac{r_s}{r}}

## Usage
These formulas can be used to understand the basic properties of black holes and are foundational in astrophysical calculations.
